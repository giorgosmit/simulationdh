# INTRODUCTION

The tutorial was held on 11th July, 2016 within the Digital Humanities conference at Krakow, Poland.

We recommend to begin by taking a look at the introductory presentation at *doc/slides.pdf*. The second step would be to setup the environment and follow the tutorial at *doc/DHtutorial.pdf*. You can finally check the result against the code found in *src/DHworkshop.py* and extend the model to solve the challenges defined at the end of *slides.pdf*

# SETUP

A Python programming environment should be configured in the computer before starting the tutorial. One of the easiest ways is to install the Anaconda suite which will
deploy all the needed dependencies.

In addition, you will need a development environment where to type and execute our source code. You can use spyder which is already part of Anaconda:

1. Go to: https://www.continuum.io/
2. Choose a Python 3.5 windows, linux or osx installer depending on your system (Attention: please make sure you install python 3.5 and not python 2.7).
3. Follow the installation instructions
4. Launch Spyder from the Anaconda Navigator.
